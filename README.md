# category-set-graph

Consider the category X containing two objects a and b
 * there is a morphism from a to b
 * and a morphism from b to a

Consider also the category **Set** whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are functions between sets

Show that a graph is the same thing as a functor from X to **Set**.

I.E.
 * if i give you a graph you give me the functor
 * and if i give you a functor you tell me what the graph is
